There are two main branches:
master - which is meant for the OSdev community and OS developers at large
YOU ARE HERE-> xomb - builds a xomb specific toolchain and can be a model for how to fill in newlib-files/ stubs

This script will build general buildtools for a 64 bit elf target. It will compile:

binutils (ld, bfd, gas)
gmp
mpfr
gcc (gcc, g++, gfortran)
newlib

USAGE:

To use this, optionally edit XOmB specific hooks in newlib-files/, then run:

./build.sh

This will build the tools in the 'local' directory.

FEATURES:

1. Will compile a complete C, C++ and fortran toolchain.

PREREQUISITES:

The gcc tools require m4, autoconf, automake and texinfo (or another source of makeinfo) to successfully compile.
